It gives off no sound when it is crumpled or folded, it is quiet and pliant to the touch as the leaf of a tree."

                <p>Jun'ichirō Tanizaki (谷崎 潤一郎, Tanizaki Jun'ichirō, 24 July 1886 – 30 July 1965) was one of the major writers of modern Japanese literature, and he is perhaps the most popular Japanese novelist after Natsume Sōseki. Some of his works present a shocking world of sexuality and destructive erotic obsessions. Others, less sensational, subtly portray the dynamics of family life in the context of the rapid changes in 20th-century Japanese society. Frequently his stories are narrated in the context of a search for cultural identity in which constructions of the West and Japanese tradition are juxtaposed.

                <br><br>He was one of six authors on the final shortlist for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, the year before his death.</p>
