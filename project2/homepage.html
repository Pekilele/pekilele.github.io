        Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the
        temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed
        alcove. So dark are these alcoves, So dark are these
        alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly

        all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how

        disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.
        For the painting here is nothing more than another
        delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light can play;
        it performs precisely the same function as the
        sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such

        Of course the Japanese room
        does have its picture alcove, and
        in it a hanging scroll and a flower
        arrangement. But the scroll and
        the flowers serve not as ornament
        but rather to give depth to the
        shadows. We value a scroll above
        all for the way it blends with the
        <p class="text_sm">walls of the alcove,</p>
        and thus we consider the
        mounting quite as important as
        the calligraphy or painting. Even
        the greatest masterpiece will lose
        its worth as a scroll if it fails to
        blend with the alcove, while a
        work of no particular distinction
        may blend beautifully with the
        room and set off to unexpected
        advantage both itself and its
        surroundings.
