            The study bay, as

            sidelong rays from

            In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from
            the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair
            days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely
            varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely
            immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper
            itself. I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though
            some misty film were blunting my vision. The light from the pale white paper,
            powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by
            the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
            <p class="con2_text_text">indistinguishable.</p>
