        <div>And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows</div>

        <div>Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the
            eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden
            steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us
            <span class="glow">the charm of a room.</span>

            We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. The
            storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will
            almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty
            of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the glow surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for
            to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are
            not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from
            room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as
            in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these delicate
            differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.
