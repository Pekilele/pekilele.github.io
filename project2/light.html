    We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. The
    storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will
    almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty
    of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the <span class="glow">glow</span> surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for
    to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are
    not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from
    room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as
    in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these delicate
    differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.
