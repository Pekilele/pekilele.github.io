            <p class="box2_text1">In the temples of Japan, a roof of <span>heavy</span> tiles is first
                laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created by
                the eaves the rest of the structure is built.</p>
            <p class="box2_text2">
                The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote
                countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the
                impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands
                beneath the eaves.
                Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first
                strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves.

            <p class="box2_text4">
                Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but <span>invisible</span>.

            The roof of a Japanese house is a parasol. <br>Click the parasol to form shadow.

        <div class="box3_text">
            In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the
            pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they
            are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they
            are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. If the
            roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor
            as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of
            reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete,
            and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would
            no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.
