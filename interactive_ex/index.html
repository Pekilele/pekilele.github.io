                <h2 id="second">An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

                    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
                    
                    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
                    
                    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</h2>
                <h3 id="third">As great as being offered Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” as a project to write was, the real excitement for me was being re-teamed with Howard for our first project together since our Off-Broadway days. We had been apart for a while. Howard directed and wrote on Smile with Marvin Hamlisch.</h3>
                <h4 id="fourth">I wrote “Kicks: The Showgirl Musical” with “Dreamgirls” writer, Tom Eyen. And, ironic as it seems, after what Mermaid has come to mean in the world, I will always consider it as our follow-up to “Little Shop of Horrors”.</h4>
