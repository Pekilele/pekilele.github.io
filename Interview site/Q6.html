        <p><img src="images/gia2.jpg" width="100" height="100">I’ve always been interested in art as a child, but I put that interest aside in order to focus more on sports and academics. I eventually gained an interest in art again when I won a gold key from the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards my sophomore year of high school. It wasn’t anything special, but it was enough to push me towards art and lead me to where I am now.</p>
