    <p>Hi guys! I'm Mickey Mouse. Do you want to hear my story as been a captain? One day, I pilots a steam river sidewheeler. I cheerfully whistles "Steamboat Bill" and sounds the boat's three whistles......</p>

    <p>As you know from the video, soon the real captain, Pete, appears and orders me off the bridge. I blows a raspberry at Pete. Pete attempts to kick me, but I rush away in time and Pete accidentally kicks himself in the rear. I rush down the stairs, slip on a bar of soap on the boat's deck, and lands in a bucket of water. A parrot laughs at me, and I throw the bucket at it.

        Pete, who has been watching the whole thing, pilots the steamboat himself. He bites off some chewing tobacco and spits into the wind. The spit flies backward and rings the boat's bell. Amused by this, Pete spits again, but this time the spit hits him in the face, making him fuss.
        
        In the ebd, the steamboat makes a stop at "Podunk Landing" to pick up a cargo of various livestock. </p>
    
    <h3>It seems like a humorous story right? But my real feeling on this journy is feel like the hell. The life of being suppressed by Pete every day is enough! I am so sad and angry.<br><br>----!!Watch the film again along with this bgm from Soundcloud and mute the video! You can feel my ambitiousness!!----</h3>

    <p>Although I am not the captain, I am more famous than Pete! At least I am the main character of Mickey Mouse. This short film is especially notable for being the first Disney cartoon with synchronized sound, and even LEGO created a Disney Steamboat Willie toy for me.</p>
